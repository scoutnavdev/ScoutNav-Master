# ScoutNav-Master
ScoutNav is a free and open source group navigation system. Ever had a large group, traveling in many different vehicles? Forget using 
paper to get directions, only to have extra people show up. Use ScoutNav. Type in start and end address, and ScoutNav does the rest. Built 
for areas with little cell service, and compatible with Google Maps and Waze, it makes everyone happy. Also built to be secure and insanly simple to use.
