            <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>Privacy is a top priority for me- espescially in a world where increasingly businesses are tracking indivuduals. I take industry-standard steps to secure you (like SSL).</p>
    <h2>So... What is tracked?</h2>
    <p>You are recorded as a "user", to let me know someone visited a page on my system, which pages, and for how long. In addition, your basic location is gathered from your IP address (country, nothing else.) It's that simple. I don't know and frankly don't care about anything else. The only exception to this is if you're visiting using a strange or uncommon method (eg, TOR) you will be prompted with a CAPCHTA, and tracked in accordance with CloudFlare's policies. Any photos uploaded to any ScoutNav system is scanned using multiple databases for child abuse purposes and to ensure compliance with the BSA's Youth Protection policies. Photos are never shared with third parties unless they are flagged, and the scanning process utilizes proprietary methods without sending out images over the web.</p>
    <h2>What I don't have control over</h2>
    <p>I cannot control tracking from external sites or apps (eg. Google Maps, Waze) They do their own things, and their privacy policy can be viewed on their websites.</p>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>In our modern world, hacking is becoming more and more of a problem for businesses. Luckily, ScoutNav is built from the ground up to be bulletproof, which includes security. Industry standard steps are taken to secure all data, not just the important things. Examples of this <i>include</i> (but are not limited to): SSL encryption (work in progress), CloudFlare DDOS protection, and secure password storage. Additionally, all data is backed up in multiple redundent and geographically isolated locations. These steps are just a few taken to secure data and ensure staying one step ahead of crimminal individuals.</p>
